			The clock speed in Hz. Ranges from 100000 (100 kHz) to
			5000000 (5 Mhz). I2C busses that involve external wires may
			have to be slower, and the real maximum speed the bus will

			The I2C bus needs resistors to make sure it's in a defined
			state when nobody is talking. Many circuits have external
			pullup resistors already and turning these on will increase
			power consumption slightly and may limit the speed your bus
			can attain. Try with these off first if you don't know.
